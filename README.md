# email-automation-of-Amazon-Associates-Reports

This grabs the Daily/Monthly Earning Reports from the Amazon Affiliates Website and Mails it to multiple people via Gmail.
The reports could either be attached to the mail or pasted in the email body itself, depends on one's preference. The text in the email body could be edited however depending on individual's choice of format. 

1. login.py is where all the customisation and configuration should be done.

2. Running run.py will directly mail the reports captured in a .png format.

(This uses chrome to access the affiliates website, so the chromedriver path should properly match the path given in the run.py file)
